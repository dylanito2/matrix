MoneyLion Connected Cells In a Grid Code Challenge

Build with React

Demo: http://dylanbrevis-matrix.surge.sh

To build, either run ```npm start``` or ```yarn start``` from in the *matrix* directory and go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to implement the percent button or the negative number button, although I intend to over the weekend.  Additionally, I would refactor my App.js and move some of the logic to a more appropriate place.
